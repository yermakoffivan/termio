/// The shell: four native tabs — Projects (including its pushed project pages),

/// A child `UITabBarController` owns those four home stacks, giving the app the
/// system Liquid Glass tab bar while this outer container continues to own the
/// live terminal overlays and their lifecycle.
/// Screen-specific actions stay beside their page title, leaving the bottom
/// edge to one stable navigation surface on every home screen, pushed project
/// pages included.
/// Tapping a session anywhere slides its terminal in full-screen over the
/// whole thing, and "back" slides it away to reveal the tabs wherever they
/// were. Screens draw their own chrome (large titles, glass buttons, the
/// terminal its compact header), so the navigation bars stay hidden.
///
/// **Why containment instead of a UINavigationController.** Destroying a
/// libghostty surface races the engine's render/IO threads — the source of the
/// iOS `drawFrame` / `os_unfair_lock` crashes. The wrapper frees the surface
/// the instant its view leaves the window (`UITerminalView.didMoveToWindow`),
/// and rebuilds it on re-attach, so a plain push/pop tore down and recreated a
/// surface on every back-and-reopen — racing the engine every time. Here a
/// switched-away terminal is only *hidden*: its view stays installed in the
/// window, so the surface is never freed and never rebuilt. It is torn down
/// only on eviction/close, detached and idle, with no in-flight frames to race.
/// Keyed by `MockSession.key`; a small LRU bounds live surfaces.
